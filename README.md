**Revolutionary QR code technology that stores 3x more data in the same space using CMY color encoding.**

Instead of traditional 1-bit-per-pixel QR codes, ColorQR uses **3 bits per pixel** by encoding data across three color channels, achieving unprecedented data density while maintaining reliable scanning.

## üöÄ The Data Density Revolution

### Traditional QR vs ColorQR Storage
- **Traditional QR**: 1 bit per pixel = limited data capacity
- **ColorQR**: **3 bits per pixel** = **3x more data** in the same physical space

### Real-World Impact
```
21√ó21 Traditional QR:  ~25 characters max
21√ó21 ColorQR:        ~75 characters (3x more!)

25√ó25 Traditional QR:  ~47 characters max  
25√ó25 ColorQR:        ~141 characters (3x more!)
```

This means you can store **entire paragraphs, long URLs, detailed contact information, or complex data** in QR codes that would typically only hold a few words.

## üéØ How 3-Bit-Per-Pixel Works

### CMY Color Channel Encoding
ColorQR splits each pixel into three information channels:
- **üîµ Cyan Channel**: Bit 1 of data
- **üî¥ Magenta Channel**: Bit 2 of data  
- **üü° Yellow Channel**: Bit 3 of data

Each pixel can be in one of **8 states** (2¬≥ = 8), compared to traditional QR's **2 states** (black/white):
1. `000` = White (no color)
2. `001` = Yellow  
3. `010` = Magenta
4. `011` = Red (Magenta + Yellow)
5. `100` = Cyan
6. `101` = Green (Cyan + Yellow)
7. `110` = Blue (Cyan + Magenta)
8. `111` = Black (all colors)

## ÔøΩ Quick Start Guide

### Bit-Level Encoding Process

**Traditional QR Encoding:**
```
Each pixel: 1 bit (Black = 1, White = 0)
Data stream: 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0
Pixels needed: 8 pixels for 8 bits
```

**ColorQR Encoding:**
```
Each pixel: 3 bits (8 possible color combinations)  
Data stream: 101 110 010 011
Pixels needed: 4 pixels for 12 bits (3x density!)
```

### Color-to-Data Mapping
| Color | Binary | Data Value |
|-------|--------|------------|
| White | 000 | 0 |
| Yellow | 001 | 1 |
| Magenta | 010 | 2 |
| Red | 011 | 3 |
| Cyan | 100 | 4 |
| Green | 101 | 5 |
| Blue | 110 | 6 |
| Black | 111 | 7 |

## üöÄ Quick Start - Test the 3x Difference

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### How much more data can ColorQR store?
**Exactly 3x more** than traditional QR codes. If a traditional QR code stores 100 characters, the same-sized ColorQR stores 300 characters.

### Why not just make traditional QR codes bigger?
**Size efficiency matters!** A 21√ó21 ColorQR can store the same data as a 37√ó37 traditional QR code. This means:
- **Smaller printed codes** on business cards and materials
- **Faster scanning** due to fewer pixels to process  
- **Better readability** from greater distances

### Do ColorQR codes work with regular QR scanners?
**No** - ColorQR uses a specialized CMY encoding that requires the ColorQR decoder. The 3x density gain requires custom decoding algorithms that regular QR readers don't support.

### What's the maximum data capacity?
- **21√ó21**: ~75 characters (vs 25 traditional)
- **25√ó25**: ~141 characters (vs 47 traditional)  
- **29√ó29**: ~225 characters (vs 75 traditional)
- **Up to 77√ó77**: 1500+ characters in a single code!

### Can I print ColorQR codes?
**Yes!** ColorQR uses CMY colors specifically chosen for optimal printing. The color model matches how printers work, giving excellent print quality and scan reliability.

### Is my data secure?
**Completely private** - All encoding/decoding happens in your browser. Your data never touches any servers.
